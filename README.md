# 🗃️ Product Sales Database Project – SQL & Relational Data Analysis

This project demonstrates practical SQL database design and querying skills by building and interacting with a **relational database** for managing and analyzing product sales data. It simulates a real-world e-commerce or inventory system, where product, pricing, and stock information must be maintained and retrieved efficiently.

The dataset (`products.csv`) contains structured records including product names, prices, categories, and stock levels. The accompanying SQL file (`Project_1.sql`) covers **end-to-end database management tasks** using MySQL, including:

- Table creation with data types and constraints
- Data insertion from CSV using the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command
- Basic and advanced **SQL queries** (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY)
- Use of **aggregate functions** (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- Querying products by price ranges, stock levels, and alphabetical order
- Schema design for scalability and real-time analytics

This project highlights fundamental knowledge in **database normalization**, **data ingestion**, **query optimization**, and **report generation**, making it highly relevant for roles involving data engineering, backend development, and business intelligence.
